# Very short introduction to Data Science.
An compressive introduction to Data Science. Exploration of basis
__David Sierra Porta (c) 2022__

## Preface
This (little) book has been designed to introduce the basic elements of data science in various contexts of problems that are usually solved in the discipline. We will try to cover many topics in a self-contained view, in this way the reader learns little by little with modules that advance in complexity and extension of techniques and methodologies. A version of this content in a PDF book format is being built, but is not yet available and will hopefully be completed soon.
