# Very short introduction to Data Science.
An compressive introduction to Data Science. Exploration of basis
__David Sierra Porta (c) 2022__

## Preface
This (little) book has been designed to introduce the basic elements of data science in various contexts of problems that are usually solved in the discipline. We will try to cover many topics in a self-contained view, in this way the reader learns little by little with modules that advance in complexity and extension of techniques and methodologies. A version of this content in a PDF book format is being built, but is not yet available and will hopefully be completed soon.

## Introduction

In recent years, the worlds of industry, academia, and government have been calling for more capable and productive data science professionals, and the demand for data science professionals in the industry has been growing rapidly. This book presents concepts and skills that can help you meet the challenges of real-world data analysis. It covers concepts of probability, statistical inference, linear regression, and machine learning. It also helps you develop skills such as `Python` programming, data management with `Pandas`, data visualization with `Matplotlib`, `Pyplot`, `Seaborn`, `Bokeh`, etc, algorithm construction, file organization with `UNIX/Linux` shell, version control with `Git` and `GitHub`, and preparing reproducible documents with `Overleaf` and `Python markdown`. The book is divided into six parts: an introduction to Python, Data Visualization, Data Management, Statistics with Python, Machine Learning, and Productivity Tools. Each part has several chapters designed to be presented as a lecture and includes dozens of exercises distributed throughout the chapters.
